# Aalternative-another-particule-conductor
Alternative another particule conductor. I want to find something with automorphism, homeomorphism and diffeomorphism. We can start with ln(6x) because I mostly don't use
the 6 number in my stuffs. Then, is there a non trivial external automorphism in relationship with ln(6x) ? For diffeomorphism, we may be able
to use the picard number. Then, maybe the rank of ln(6x) must be increased to  fulfill this step. We have now : ln(6x)^6 because  I oftern dont use
the six number. The two layers we found are : bronze (ln(6x)^6),....
